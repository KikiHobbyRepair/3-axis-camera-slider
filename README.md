# 3-axis-camera-slider
My newest DIY project is a 3 Axis motorised camera slicer. It is capable of handling smaller DSLR cameras and phones. It is portable because can be operated from a battery or alternatively from a DC power supply.
I will also post a video later on about the full build process. I will put a link here as soon as it is published.

Parts list:
- 3D printed parts (preferred: PETG)
- openbuilds V wheel gentry. Most probably these are mostly the same but this is what I used: https://www.ebay.com/itm/403322339944
- 2040 V slot aluminum extrusion profile (I used 600mm long)
- 3 pcs Nema 17 stepper motors (I used 2pcs 0,9deg 2A and 1pc 1,8deg 2A version). High torque is needed especially for the tiliting mechanism
